Code-splitting and Lazy Loading
Another important optimization technique for a React app is Code Splitting. 
React allows you to split your large bundle file into multiple smaller chunks 
using Code splitting. And these chunks are dynamically imported using import()  
and then loaded on-demand using React.lazy.

Step 1: Transform the normal React imports to dynamic imports.
const Home = React.lazy(() => import("./components/Home"));
const About = React.lazy(() => import("./components/About"));

Step 2: Add Suspense and fallback mechanism
<React.Suspense fallback={<p>Loading page...</p>}>  
    <Route path="/" exact>    
        <Home />  
    </Route>  
    <Route path="/about">    
        <About />  
    </Route>
</React.Suspense>
