You should never store derived state.
derived state is some state in an application that can be derived 
or created from the already stored state of that application

The code below is storing derived state. The selectedUser is derived state 
from the users array. This is because the name of the selectedUser is 
defined in the users array and should not be duplicated in the selectedUser 
variable. By having this duplication the app needs to update the selectedUser 
every time that user is changed in the users array.

function User() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([
    { id: 1, name: 'Kyle' },
    { id: 2, name: 'John' }
  ])
  const [selectedUser, setSelectedUser] = useState()

  function selectUser(id) {
    const user = users.find(user => user.id === id)
    setSelectedUser({ ...user }
  }

  function updateUser(id, name) {
    setUsers(prevUsers => {
      const newUsers = [...prevUsers]
      const user = newUsers.find(user => user.id === id)
      user.name = name
      return newUsers
    })
  }

  return users.map(user => user.name).join(', ')
}
