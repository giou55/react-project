Hooks were added to React in version 16.8.
Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. 
Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.
Hooks will not work in React class components.
If you have stateful logic that needs to be reused in several components, 
you can build your own custom Hooks.


There are 3 rules for hooks:
Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
Hooks cannot be conditional


useState
useEffect
useContext
useReducer
useCallback
useMemo
useRef
useTransition
useDeferredValue


These hooks are rarely if ever used:
useLayoutEffect
useDebugValue
useImperativeHandle
useId
